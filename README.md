# CPU Scheduling Algorithm Visualizer

## Description

The CPU Scheduling Algorithm Visualizer is a web application designed to help users understand and analyze CPU scheduling algorithms. It provides an interactive Gantt chart representation of process execution, along with key performance metrics such as average completion time and turnaround time.

This project aims to make complex scheduling algorithms more accessible and visually engaging, serving as a valuable educational tool for students and professionals in the field of operating systems.

## Tech Stack

- **JavaScript:** The core logic of the scheduling algorithms and dynamic visualizations are implemented in JavaScript.
- **HTML/CSS:** The user interface of the application is built using HTML and CSS, ensuring a user-friendly and visually appealing design.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Gantt Chart:** Visualizes the execution timeline of processes under various scheduling algorithms.
- **Algorithm Selection:** Allows users to choose from a range of CPU scheduling algorithms for visualization and comparison.
- **Performance Metrics:** Calculates and displays important metrics, including average completion time and turnaround time.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for an intuitive and responsive user experience.

## Challenges

- Implementing Scheduling Algorithms: Accurately simulating real-world scenarios for different scheduling algorithms was a significant challenge, requiring in-depth knowledge of JavaScript.
- Gantt Chart Creation: Creating an interactive and visually appealing Gantt chart demanded a strong grasp of both JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

## Getting Started

To run the CPU Scheduling Algorithm Visualizer locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Select a CPU scheduling algorithm from the available options.
2. Input the process details (arrival time and burst time) as needed.
3. Click the "Visualize" button to see the Gantt chart and performance metrics.
4. Explore different algorithms and scenarios for comparison and analysis.

## Outcome

This project has helped me enhance my programming skills, particularly in JavaScript, and has demonstrated my ability to design and develop web applications that are both functional and visually appealing. It serves as a valuable educational resource for those looking to gain insights into CPU scheduling algorithms.
